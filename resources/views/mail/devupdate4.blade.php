# <a href="https://dungeon.digital">Dungeon Digital</a> Development Update v0.2.7

<p>I've been messing around with text to speech with room description text; Other than that development has only consisted of bug fixes.</p>

<p>My D&D group disbanded late last year and as such I have not been able to test the site properly</p>

<p>The main issue and stagnation of development is due to lack of any kind of Feedback, I can see new users signing up, and some existing users returning, I just want to know a few things from you (if possible):</p>

<ul style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <li>Any bugs that you may have encountered</li>
    <li>What you think of the site in general</li>
    <li>What you would like done as a priority</li>
    <li>Any user interaction advice; what would make the site more user friendly</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to join the public discord to discuss and get involved!</p>

<p>My real life work is quite light at the moment, so I have time to work on Dungeon Digital at the moment</p>
